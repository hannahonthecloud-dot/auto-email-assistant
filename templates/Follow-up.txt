Subject: Following up on the {{role}} position at {{company}}

Hi {{recruiter_name}},

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up on my application for the {{role}} role at {{company}}.

I’m still very interested in joining your team and contributing my growing experience in Cloud and DevOps. I’ve been working on real-world projects that involve automating deployments and improving system reliability — areas I know are important at {{company}}.

If there’s anything I can provide to support the process, I’d be happy to.

Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,  
Ngozi Hannah Opara
